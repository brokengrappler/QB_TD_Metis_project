# QB TD projection (Metis - Linear Regression project)

#### Description 
Create a linear regression model that will project TD passes to be thrown for starting QBs in a subsequent year. 

Test set (2019 TD projects on 2018 YTD stats input) had a $$R^2 of 0.351.

#### Assignment requirements
This project was selected to fulfill the requirements of building a linear regression model to demonstrate and implement knowledge of:
- web scraping
- numpy and pandas
- statsmodels and scikit-learn

#### Data Sources
- [pro-football-reference.com](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/)

#### File Contents
- `Scrape_qb_list.py` Compile list of active quarterbacks between a specified number of years.
- `PFR_scrape.py` Acquire data from pro-football-reference for QBs in the Scrape_qb_list and creates a pandas dataframe.

- Files to be added later:
1) Dataframe cleaning and filtering
2) Linear regression model

#### Dependencies
- Python 3.6 (and above)
- pandas
- numpy
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn
- bs4
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- collections
